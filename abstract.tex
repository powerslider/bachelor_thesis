The purpose of this thesis is to develop analytics methods for and visualisations of the news data from a public Ontotext service called News On the Web (NOW) using semantic technologies, standards of the Semantic Web and Linked Open Data. More specific tasks are generating a "News Map of Today's news" and recommending linked news and objects based on analyzing "hidden champions". Hidden champions are concepts which are not directly mentioned in the news, but are linked in the graph with a few concepts which are. For this purpose a cognitive technique called "priming" is used in which the popularity of the mentioned concepts is being spread out across the knowledge graph, following the principle of spreading activation in neural networks. The News Map will be visualised in the form of a word cloud in various options: direct popularity of the concepts based on mentions count in the news and degree of importance of these news, relative popularity - where the popularity within the current day is normalized against the popularity within the last year, concepts that are "hidden champions" and a combination of "hidden champions" and relative popularity. Analogous maps will be created for a separate news article as a way to visualise the important subjects in it.
